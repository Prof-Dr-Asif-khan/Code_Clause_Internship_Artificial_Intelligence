1. Project Goals
Develop an interactive system that can recognize and classify various hand gestures from a live video stream or camera feed.
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate gesture classification.
Enable real-time recognition for potential applications in device control and virtual environments.
2. Key Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detects gestures in real time through a live video feed.
Multiple Gesture Classes: Recognizes different hand gestures with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Displays recognized gestures on-screen with a clean, easy-to-understand layout.
Customizable Model: The deep learning model can be customized to recognize additional gestures by retraining with new data.
3. Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
Image Processing: OpenCV
Neural Networks: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
4. Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/engrmumtazali0112/Gesture-Recognition-System.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Gesture-Recognition-System

Launch the program by running the gesture_recognition.py script.
Use the live video feed to display hand gestures in front of the camera.
The system will display the detected gesture on the screen in real time.
6. Project Structure
gesture_recognition.py: Main script for running the gesture recognition system.
models/: Contains the trained CNN model for gesture detection.
utils/: Helper functions for processing video feeds and gesture classification.
data/: Folder for training and test datasets (if retraining is required).
7. Learning Outcomes
Mastered techniques in computer vision and deep learning.
Gained experience with CNNs for image classification.
Enhanced knowledge in real-time video processing using OpenCV.
Developed skills in model training, tuning, and evaluation.
8. Future Improvements
Expand Gesture Library: Increase the number of detectable gestures.
Improve Accuracy: Fine-tune the CNN model for better accuracy.
